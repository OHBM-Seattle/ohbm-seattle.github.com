<p>Start responding to the hackathon challenges using data from ADNI - the <a href="http://www.adni-info.org">Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; <a href="http://www.adni-info.org">http://www.adni-info.org</a>) represents among the largest neuroimaging archive of data from Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI), and healthy control subjects in the world. Now entering its third phase (ADNI, ADNI GO and ADNI 2), ADNI 2 is studying the rate of change of cognition, function, brain structure, and biomarkers in 150 controls, 450 MCI, 150 with mild to moderate AD and a new group of 100 people with significant, yet subtle, memory complaints, referred to as the significant memory concern cohort.  These data are openly available for analysis by approved scientists for research purposes, development of data processing methodologies, modeling, etc. Some conditions do apply, including that each person must gain access to the data through the normal application process and channels and the requested data may not be shared among other participants.  Full details on the data access policy are provided here (<a href="http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/data-samples/access-data">http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/data-samples/access-data</a>).</p>

The <a href="http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu" title="LONI Pipeline">LONI Pipeline</a> is available on the Cloud as an <a href="http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu/products-services/pipeline-server-on-ec2" title="Pipeline on EC2">Amazon EC2 Instance</a> (i.e., virtual machine).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p> Both free and paid AWS/EC2 subscriptions can be used to launch the DPS (Distributed Pipeline Server) on EC2, and click Launch Instance. Then remote clients can connect to the hostname of that instance (e.g., ec2-184-73-1-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com). After connecting to the server, you can open a workflow under Server Library and run. The Pipeline library includes 100’s of imaging and genetics software suites, atomic processing tools, datasets and resources.  For additional details on LONI Pipeline, please see <a href="http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu">http://pipeline.loni.ucla.edu</a>.</p>

This HBM Hackathon accessible repository is an excellent resource for finding significant relationships amongst neuroimaging, clinical, and –omics data within the National Database for Autism Research (<a href="http://ndar.nih.gov">NDAR</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>Background</h4>

<p><a href="http://ndar.nih.gov">NDAR</a> is an NIH-funded research data repository that aims to accelerate progress in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) research through data sharing, data harmonization, and the reporting of research results. NDAR is a restricted access data repository, offering a wealth of data related to human subjects research in autism.  Applying for access prior to the OHBM hack event is essential.  Additionally, it serves as a scientific community platform to multiple other research repositories, allowing for aggregation and secondary analysis of clinically captured research data.</p>

<h4>Data and Tools</h4>

<p>Continually updated through the contributions of primary researchers, NDAR provides authorized researchers access to contemporary relevant raw data in a relatively short amount of time after its collection.  The database currently is sharing data on <strong>48,135 individuals</strong> spread over <strong>64,335 subject / age time points</strong> across hundreds of clinical, omics, and imaging data structures harmonized using a common data dictionary and a common subject identifier (see <a href="http://ndar.nih.gov/ndar_data_dictionary.html">NDAR data dictionary</a>).  In addition to NDAR, autism data from the Autism Genetic Research Exchange, Interactive Autism Network, the Autism Tissue Program, and the normative Pediatric MRI data repository are also available, but also require approval.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>NDAR provides simple cohort selection/filtering on a variety of scores and types of data available at <a href="http://ndar.nih.gov/query_data.html">http://ndar.nih.gov/query_data.html</a>.  Data selected can be downloaded or pre-loaded onto an Amazon EC2 instance for evaluation using the <a href="http://www.nitrc.org/ce-forum">NITRC Computational Environment</a>, <a href="http://neuro.debian.net">NeuroDebian</a> or other available tool sets. NDAR’s rich datasets are stored in Amazon’s S3, which facilitates parallel processing and better transfer rates.</p>

<p>Download packages from NDAR include a single, tab-delimited text file for each data structure received, as well as any related files (e.g. imaging or omics) and a “Create Amazon RDS database” capability scheduled for May 2013.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>NDAR is a restricted access data repository.  Review what’s available for download from <a href="http://ndar.nih.gov/query_data.html">http://ndar.nih.gov/query_data.html</a> and apply for access at <a href="http://ndar.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/access.html">http://ndar.nih.gov/ndarpublicweb/access.html</a>.</p>
