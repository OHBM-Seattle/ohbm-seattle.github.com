We are pleased to announce that the 2013 OHBM meeting in Seattle will include a competition and congress-long data analysis and resource building event called the OHBM Cloud Hack.

<!-- more -->

#### Background

The 2013 OHBM meeting will include an integrated hack room and associated cloud computing contest called the OHBM Cloud Hack. Cloud Hack will include a meeting-long venue on the main poster/exhibit floor space, dedicated cloud-accessible data and software. These resources will be available to participants beginning two months ahead of the meeting, with in-kind support from Amazon Web Services in the form of cloud computing credits.

#### Purpose

The goals of Cloud Hack are to accelerate the development of a critical mass of cloud-based data, analytic, and computational resources for human brain mapping, and to provide OHBM attendees with access to and knowledge about these resources.

#### Venue

OHBM has allocated approximately 3000 square feet of space on the poster/exhibit hall for a _Cloud Hack Room_ that will include a podium and presentation eqipment. The room will accommodate collaboration as well as formal presentations accomodating up to 300 people. Sponsoring and contributing groups will be present to provide ongoing consultation and assistance with their respective resources, and may optionally make brief presentations at the podium. 

#### Contest and Challenges

The contest will be organized around three Challenges, two of them pre-announced and open to work in advance of the meeting; and one announced at the time of the meeting.  At least one team leader/presenter must attend the meeting; off-site team members are allowed and encouraged, but will not eligible for all resources made available to registered participants (e.g., Amazon Web Service credits). A brief overview of the challenges are provided here and a more detailed post will be provided separately.

__Challenge 1.__ Best imaging and gene expression relationship discovered via integration of imaging data with the Allen Human Brain Atlas.

Here is a published example that would be responsive to this challenge:  Mathias Schroeter from Max Planck Institute will also be one of the speakers at the Imaging-Gene Expression Symposia during OHBM to talk about this paper.
 
Mueller K, Sacher J, Arelin K, Holiga S, Kratzsch J, et al. Overweight and obesity are associated with neuronal injury in the human cerebellum and hippocampus in young adults: a combined MRI, serum marker and gene expression study. Transl Psychiatry 2: e200. doi:10.1038/tp.2012.121.

__Challenge 2.__ Best cortical neural systems relationship or visualization based on integration of resting state fMRI data with other Cloud Hack accessible datasets. 

Here is a published example that would be responsive to this challenge:

Uddin LQ, Supekar K, Amin H, Rykhlevskaia E, Nguyen DA, Greicius MD, Menon V. Dissociable connectivity within human angular gyrus and intraparietal sulcus: evidence from functional and structural connectivity. Cereb Cortex. 2010 20:2636-46. 

__Challenge 3.__ To be announced the week of the meeting. This "mystery" challenge is to be addressed entirely during the meeting using resources made openly available to the brain mapping community.

#### Thank you and good luck!
