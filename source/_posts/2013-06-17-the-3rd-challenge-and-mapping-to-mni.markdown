MNI Mashup: Most innovative map or aggregation of information in the MNI 152 standard.

<!-- more -->

This challenge challenge is to be addressed entirely during the meeting using resources made openly available to the brain mapping community.


Example projects:

- Aggregating standard MNI space 3D shape models of neuroanatomical structures
- "Dense brain information map". Given an (x,y,z,r) tell me everything you can about (x,y,z,r), especially including uncertainty of that information. Here are a few examples of information that could be returned:

  - gene expression (and the uncertainty would be high if imputing and low if exactly at a probe location)
  - cognitive atlas terms and therefore publications and derivatives associated with that location ( a la neurosynth)
  - variation in cortical thickness
  - functional connectivity 
  - likelihood of major fiber bundles in that location
  - registration inconsistency/uncertainty
  - cytoarchitecture variation (neuron types, etc.,.)
  - associated disorders
  - data from other species

Judging criteria:

- Scientific impact
- Commitment to open availability of the resulting resource
- Extensibility
- Inclusion of quantified uncertainty

Rules

- Participants must use publicly available data that is listed on the HBM Hackathon Blog. If a public dataset is not listed that you want to use, we would love to add it to the list, just contact us: hbm.hackathon@gmail.com
- Participants can use any computational resources available to them, but judging will take into account innovative use of cloud computing and how openly available the approach is (see Judging)
- At least one team leader/presenter must attend the meeting
- Off-site team members are allowed and encouraged, but will not be eligible for all resources made available to registered OHBM attendees (e.g., cloud computing credits)
